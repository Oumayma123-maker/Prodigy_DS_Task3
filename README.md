# Prodigy Infotech Internship : Task 3 :

🌳 Decision Tree Model for Predicting Customer Deposits 💼💰

📊 Project Overview :

This project builds a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will make a deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

📂 Dataset :

The dataset includes the following features:

Demographic 🧑‍💼: Age, job, marital status, education, etc.

Behavioral 🏠💳: Housing loan, personal loan, contact details, etc.

🎯 Target Variable :

Deposit 💰: Indicates whether the customer will make a deposit (yes/no).

🧠 Knowledge Gained :

Data Preprocessing 🔄: 

Learned to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features for machine learning.

Decision Tree 🌳: 

Gained insights into decision trees.

Hyperparameter Tuning 🛠️: 

Improved model performance using Grid Search CV to find optimal parameters like max_depth, min_samples_split, and min_samples_leaf.

Model Evaluation 📏: Applied metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.

Model Optimization 🚀: Understood the importance of hyperparameter tuning for enhancing the model's predictive power.

⚙️ Steps Involved :

1. Data Preprocessing 🧹 :

-Managed missing values.

-Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding

-Scaled numeric variables to normalize the data.

3. Model Building 🏗️ :

-Utilized sklearn's DecisionTreeClassifier to build the initial model.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning 🔧 :

Applied Grid Search CV to optimize:

max_depth

min_samples_split

min_samples_leaf

6. Evaluation Metrics 📊 :

-Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

-Confusion matrix to assess model performance

📈 Results :

Best Parameters found through Grid Search CV:

max_depth: 5

min_samples_split: 2

min_samples_leaf: 1

Model Performance:

-New Accuracy Score: 0.91

📝 Conclusion :

The decision tree model effectively predicts customer deposits with an accuracy of 91%. The use of Grid Search CV for hyperparameter tuning has enhanced the model's performance by optimizing key parameters. This project demonstrates the power of decision trees in classification tasks and highlights the importance of model evaluation and optimization.
